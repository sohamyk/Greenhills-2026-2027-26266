/*
 * This file contains an example of a Linear "OpMode".
 * An OpMode is a 'program' that runs in either the autonomous or the teleop period of an FTC match.
 * The names of OpModes appear on the menu of the FTC Driver Station.
 * When a selection is made from the menu, the corresponding OpMode is executed.
 *
 * This particular OpMode illustrates driving a 4-motor Omni-Directional (or Holonomic) robot.
 * This code will work with either a Mecanum-Drive or an X-Drive train.
 * Both of these drives are illustrated at https://gm0.org/en/latest/docs/robot-design/drivetrains/holonomic.html
 * Note that a Mecanum drive must display an X roller-pattern when viewed from above.
 *
 * Also note that it is critical to set the correct rotation direction for each motor.  See details below.
 *
 * Holonomic drives provide the ability for the robot to move in three axes (directions) simultaneously.
 * Each motion axis is controlled by one Joystick axis.
 *
 * 1) Axial:    Driving forward and backward               Left-joystick Forward/Backward
 * 2) Lateral:  Strafing right and left                     Left-joystick Right and Left
 * 3) Yaw:      Rotating Clockwise and counter clockwise    Right-joystick Right and Left
 *
 * This code is written assuming that the right-side motors need to be reversed for the robot to drive forward.
 * When you first test your robot, if it moves backward when you push the left stick forward, then you must flip
 * the direction of all 4 motors (see code below).
 *
 * Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this OpMode to the Driver Station OpMode list

         *     Only colors that you assign here will be returned.
         *     If you know the sensor will be pointing to one of a few specific colors, enter them here.
         *     Or, if the sensor may be pointed randomly, provide some additional colors that may match.
         *     Possible choices are:
         *         RED, ORANGE, YELLOW, GREEN, CYAN, BLUE, PURPLE, MAGENTA, BLACK, WHITE
         *     Note: For the 2026 season ARTIFACT_PURPLE and ARTIFACT_GREEN have been added.
         *
         *     Note that in the example shown below, only some of the available colors are included.
         *     This will force any other colored region into one of these colors.
         *     eg: Green may be reported as YELLOW, as this may be the "closest" match.
